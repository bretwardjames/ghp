# Team Conventions

Rules and patterns that code must follow. These are checked by `/create-pr`.

## Code Style

- [ ] Example: Use async/await, not .then() chains
- [ ] Example: All API endpoints must use auth middleware

## Architecture

- [ ] Example: Services should not directly access repositories from other domains

## Security

- [ ] Example: Never commit .env or credentials files
- [ ] Example: All user input must be validated

## Testing

- [ ] Example: All new features need unit tests

---

Add your team's conventions above. Each rule should be:
- Clear and specific
- Checkable against code
- Actionable (what to do, not just what not to do)
